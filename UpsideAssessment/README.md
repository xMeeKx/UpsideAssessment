# Upside Technical Assessment

### Setup and Run

Thank you to the team at Upside for taking the time to review my assessment submission. This was quite an exercise for me since its been a very long time since I last used python and since I have done any testing with Android.

That being said the bulk of the time it took to deliver this assessment was consumed by the setup process. Since the last few companies I have worked with only support iOS and currently do not have any automation setup it took some time to get things working cohesively on my PC.

Within the images folder of this project you will find screenshots of the Allure reporting.
